# Manage school placements prototype

A service for training providers and schools to manage their mentors and placements.

This prototype is based on the:

- [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/)
- [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk/docs/)

## Requirements

- Node.js - version 20.x.x

## Installation

- Clone this repository to a folder on your computer
- Open Terminal
- In Terminal, change the path to the repository
- Type `npm install` to install the dependencies

## Working locally

- In Terminal, change the path to the repository
- Type `npm run dev`  and start the application

## Generating data

The prototype uses JSON files to store data and includes a set of seed data.

The seed data is copied to the working data directory (`app/data/dist`) when you run `npm install`.

You can also regenerate the data:

- In Terminal, change the path to the repository
- Type `npm run generate-data`

## Environment variables

The prototype uses environment variables to help configure the application:

| Variable | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GCP_API_KEY` | string | An API key to access the Google Places API. |
| `USE_LOGIN` | boolean | Use to turn on/off username and password login. If set to `false`, the login screen displays a list of test personas. Values: `true` or `false` |
